You're seeing this dashboard because you installed the extension in **Cursor** or **VS Code** — it runs identically in both; nothing is Cursor- or VS Code-specific about the UI you're looking at. Below the page reference, [**Supported Harnesses**](#supported-harnesses) lists every tool this dashboard can read session data from, and [**Using with Claude Code**](#using-with-claude-code) covers that data source specifically since it needs no setup at all.

## Highlights

The extension is organized into three sections: **Observe**, **Measure**, and **Improve**.

### Observe

| Page | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| **Dashboard** | Practice scores with week-over-week and month-over-month trends, skill finder summary, daily activity chart with per-harness breakdown, and top workspace stats |
| **Timeline** | Gantt-style session timeline with per-day drill-down, session overlap detection, and a searchable list view |
| **Coding Moments** | Screenshot gallery from AI coding sessions with story reels, workspace filtering, and progressive image loading |

### Measure

| Page | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| **Output** | Two tabs -- **Code Output** (generated code volume by language and workspace) and **Token Usage** (model usage table with per-model token breakdown) *(Token Usage temporarily hidden)* |
| **Burndown** | Monthly token budget progress with projection *(temporarily disabled)* |
| **Patterns** | 7x24 activity heatmap and work-life balance signals |

### Improve

| Page | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| **Anti-Patterns** | Five practice score cards (Prompt Quality, Session Hygiene, Code Review, Tool Mastery, Context Management) with detailed findings, severity ratings, concrete actions, and example prompts |
| **Skill Finder** | AI-powered analysis of repeated prompts to discover custom skill opportunities, plus matching community skills and agents from the open-source catalog |
| **Context Health** | Overall context score, agentic readiness checklist, per-harness context provision breakdown, workspace context map (treemap colored by instruction quality), and AI-powered context file review |
| **Rule Editor** | Create, edit, and live-test detection rules as markdown with form-based or raw-source editing and AI-assisted drafting |
| **Rule Playground** | Interactive REPL for the rule DSL with field browser, function catalog, and metric list |
| **Data Explorer** | Browse request and session fields, view distributions, and run ad-hoc filters |

### Level Up

| Page | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| **Learning Center** | Personalized quizzes and code-comparison rounds generated from your actual usage |
| **Achievements** | XP-based progression with Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Diamond tiers |
| **Agentic SDLC** | Track how you use AI across the full software-development lifecycle |
| **Share** | Generate a shareable stat card and export Markdown/JSON summaries |

## Supported Harnesses

| Harness | Default location |
| --- | --- |
| **Local Agent** | macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/workspaceStorage/`<br>Linux: `~/.config/Code/User/workspaceStorage/`<br>Windows: `%APPDATA%\Code\User\workspaceStorage\` |
| **Local Agent (Insiders)** | macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Code - Insiders/User/workspaceStorage/`<br>Linux: `~/.config/Code - Insiders/User/workspaceStorage/`<br>Windows: `%APPDATA%\Code - Insiders\User\workspaceStorage\` |
| **Local Agent (Server)** | Linux/macOS remote host: `~/.vscode-server/data/User/workspaceStorage/` |
| **Local Agent (Server Insiders)** | Linux/macOS remote host: `~/.vscode-server-insiders/data/User/workspaceStorage/` |
| **Xcode Copilot Chat** | `~/.config/github-copilot/xcode/` (requires `sqlite3`) |
| **Claude** | Claude Code CLI — macOS/Linux: `~/.claude/projects/`<br>Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\projects\`<br>Claude Desktop app's built-in coding agent (same session format, scanned automatically alongside the CLI) — macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/projects/`<br>Linux: `~/.config/Claude/projects/`<br>Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\projects\` |
| **Cursor** | macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/`<br>Linux: `~/.config/Cursor/User/`<br>Windows: `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\` |
| **Codex** | macOS/Linux: `~/.codex/sessions/`<br>Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\sessions\` |
| **OpenCode** | macOS/Linux: `~/.local/share/opencode/`<br>Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.local\share\opencode\` |
| **GitHub Copilot CLI** | `~/.copilot/session-state/` and `~/.copilot/history-session-state/` |

### Using with Claude Code

Claude Code isn't a host for this extension — it's just a data source, so there's nothing to install or configure inside Claude Code itself. The dashboard reads your existing session logs straight off disk the moment it opens:

- **Claude Code CLI** sessions are created automatically the first time you run `claude` in a project — no setup needed.
- **Claude Desktop app** sessions (from its built-in coding agent) are picked up from the same directory tree, right alongside the CLI's, with zero double-counting.

Open the dashboard (see **Getting Started** below) on the same machine where you use Claude Code, and your sessions show up immediately under the **Claude** harness — filter by it in the sidebar to see just that data.

### Chat

Type `@aicoach` in the **VS Code Copilot Chat** panel for conversational access to all coaching data. Slash commands `/summary`, `/improve`, `/compare`, and `/flow` give quick access to common analyses. The participant orchestrates multiple backend tools automatically to answer complex questions. This registers through VS Code's chat-participant API — Cursor uses its own chat UI, so `@aicoach` may not be reachable there. The dashboard itself (all pages listed above) works the same regardless.

## Getting Started

1. Open the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`).
2. Run **AI Engineer Coach: Open Dashboard**.
3. Use the sidebar to navigate pages. Filter by workspace or harness at the bottom.
4. Run **AI Engineer Coach: Reload Data** to re-parse after new sessions.
5. In VS Code with Copilot Chat, type `@aicoach` for conversational coaching (see [Chat](#chat)).
